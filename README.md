# GIBs: a series of reaction time games

I made these games through my middle school years when I was first exploring my interest in the differnet fields of Enineering and CS. 

GIB V1.0 was a 2 button game exactly like V1.2 but with 2 buttons instead of 4 (I didn't take a picture of it)

GIB 1.1 was just a four button version of V1.0 with a black lid as well its pictured below
