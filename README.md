# GIBs: a series of reaction time games

## I made these games through my middle school years when I was first exploring my interest in the differnet fields of Enineering and CS. 

### GIB 1.0 was a 2 button game exactly like V1.2 but with 2 buttons instead of 4 (I didn't take a picture of it)

### GIB 1.1 was just a four button version of V1.0 with a black lid as well its pictured below

### GIB 2.0 was a smaller and more compact versions of GIB 1.1.

It used a custom designed PCB with an Raspberry Pi Pico as the MCU. At this point in around 7th grade I didn't really know how electricty worked so I didn't know resistance was a thing so I kind of just didn't put resistors for the LEDs but they were fine as the MCU can't output more than 20 millamps of current anyway so yea. 

Here is the circuit diagram:
